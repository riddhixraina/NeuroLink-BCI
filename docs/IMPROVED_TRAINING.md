# Improved EEG Model Training

This document describes the improved training process for the NeuroLink-BCI CNN-LSTM model with proper train/test splits, cross-validation, and comprehensive evaluation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Proper Train/Test Split
- **Stratified splitting**: Ensures balanced class distribution across train/validation/test sets
- **Three-way split**: 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test
- **Reproducible splits**: Uses fixed random seeds for consistent results

### 2. Cross-Validation
- **5-fold stratified cross-validation**: Provides robust performance estimates
- **Mean and standard deviation**: Reports average performance with confidence intervals
- **Overfitting detection**: Identifies models that don't generalize well

### 3. Enhanced Training Process
- **Early stopping**: Prevents overfitting with configurable patience
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Reduces learning rate when validation loss plateaus
- **Gradient clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: Tracks training and validation metrics

### 4. Better Data Generation
- **Realistic EEG patterns**: Different frequency characteristics for each cognitive state
- **Balanced classes**: Equal representation of all cognitive states
- **Artifact simulation**: Includes realistic EEG artifacts and noise
- **Spatial correlation**: Simulates realistic channel relationships

### 5. Comprehensive Evaluation
- **Multiple metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Confusion matrix**: Detailed per-class performance analysis
- **Classification report**: Per-class metrics and support
- **Confidence analysis**: Prediction confidence distribution

## Training Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `N_CHANNELS` | 32 | Number of EEG channels |
| `N_TIMEPOINTS` | 256 | Time points per sample |
| `N_CLASSES` | 5 | Number of cognitive states |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 32 | Training batch size |
| `EPOCHS` | 100 | Maximum training epochs |
| `LEARNING_RATE` | 0.001 | Initial learning rate |
| `EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE` | 15 | Epochs to wait before stopping |
| `K_FOLDS` | 5 | Cross-validation folds |

## Model Architecture

The CNN-LSTM hybrid model consists of:

1. **Spatial CNN Branch**: Extracts spatial features across EEG electrodes
   - 3 convolutional layers with batch normalization
   - Global average pooling
   - Dropout for regularization

2. **Temporal LSTM Branch**: Captures temporal patterns
   - Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism
   - Layer normalization
   - Multi-head attention

3. **Fusion Network**: Combines spatial and temporal features
   - Fully connected layers with ReLU activation
   - Dropout for regularization
   - Final classification layer

## Cognitive States

The model classifies EEG signals into 5 cognitive states:

| State ID | Name | Description | EEG Characteristics |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0 | Relaxed | Calm, meditative state | High alpha (8-13 Hz), low beta |
| 1 | Focused | Concentrated attention | Balanced alpha/beta, moderate gamma |
| 2 | Stressed | High arousal, anxiety | High beta/gamma, low alpha |
| 3 | High Load | Cognitive overload | Very high beta/gamma, low alpha |
| 4 | Low Load | Minimal cognitive activity | Low overall activity, high alpha |

## Output Files

After training, the following files are generated in the `models/` directory:

- `trained_model.pth`: Complete model checkpoint with weights, config, and results
- `training_results.json`: Comprehensive training metrics and parameters
- `training_curves.png`: Visualization of training progress
- `confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix visualization

## Model Checkpoint Format

The improved model checkpoint includes:

```python
{
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'model_config': {
        'n_channels': 32,
        'n_timepoints': 256,
        'n_classes': 5
    },
    'training_history': {
        'train_loss': [...],
        'val_loss': [...],
        'train_acc': [...],
        'val_acc': [...],

        'accuracy': 0.85,
        'precision': 0.84,
        'recall': 0.85,
        'f1_score': 0.84,
        'confusion_matrix': [...],
        'classification_report': {...}
    },
    'cv_results': {
        'mean_accuracy': 0.83,
        'std_accuracy': 0.02,
        'fold_accuracies': [...],

    },
    'training_params': {...},
    'timestamp': '2024-01-01T12:00:00'
}
```

## Performance Expectations

With the improved training process, you can expect:

- **Test Accuracy**: 80-90% on synthetic data
- **Cross-validation**: 78-88% with low variance
- **F1-Score**: 0.80-0.90 (weighted average)
- **Confidence**: High confidence (>0.7) for most predictions

## Troubleshooting

### Low Accuracy
- Check if data is properly balanced
- Verify model architecture parameters
- Consider increasing training data size
- Check for data leakage in splits

### Overfitting
- Increase dropout rates
- Add more regularization
- Reduce model complexity
- Increase early stopping patience

### Poor Cross-validation Results
- Check for data distribution issues
- Verify stratified splitting
- Consider different cross-validation strategies
- Check for temporal dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Real Data Integration**: Replace synthetic data with real EEG datasets
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model architecture and training parameters
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better performance
4. **Online Learning**: Implement continuous learning from new data
5. **Deployment Optimization**: Optimize model for real-time inference
